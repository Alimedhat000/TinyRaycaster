- ESC: Exit the application

## Future Improvements
- Implement the ability to edit the map in real-time using the mouse.
- Add various types of obstacles and textures for a more engaging environment.
- Enhance the user interface with additional HUD elements and menus.
- Optimize performance for larger maps and more complex scenes.
- Implement AI-controlled enemies for dynamic gameplay.
